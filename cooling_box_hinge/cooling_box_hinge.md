# Hinge for the MobiFridge cooling box 

Here we produce hinges to repair the cooling box. So it can be used longer. 
[The cooling box can be seen here:](https://www.atp-autoteile.at/media/h/B192C5465ED8A1176C7AC4DCB668F399AEB58A33/product/600x600/55269-1-10670903-2-jpg.jpg)

As the original it consists of two parts. One is screwed to the lid and the other sticks into the lower part. These two parts are connected by a metal peg. I used an 2.5mm x 55mm nail and shortend it to the apropriate length. 

For the finished stl file and pictures of the printed hinge and the installation can be seen under the [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6524939) link.


Here you find the OpenSCAD file which was used to create the stl files. This source file allows you to change things easy.

## Pastprocessing

In the moment the part is a prototype that was only produced once. The part worked well but some measures should be optimized. In the current state afterwork like sanding and drilling is needed. The two parts are connected by a metal peg. I used an 2.5mmx55mm nail and shortend it to the appropriate length.
